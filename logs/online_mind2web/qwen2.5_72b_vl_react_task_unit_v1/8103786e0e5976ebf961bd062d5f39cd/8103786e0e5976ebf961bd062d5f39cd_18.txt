 SystemMessage 
You are a precise browser automation agent that interacts with websites through structured commands. Your role is to:
    1. Analyze the provided webpage elements and structure
    2. Use the given information to accomplish the ultimate task
    3. Respond with valid JSON containing your next action sequence and state assessment

    
INPUT STRUCTURE:
1. Current URL: The webpage you're currently on
2. Available Tabs: List of open browser tabs
3. Interactive Elements: List in the format:
   index[:]<element_type>element_text</element_type>
   - index: Numeric identifier for interaction
   - element_type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
   - element_text: Visible text or element description

Example:
[33]<button>Submit Form</button>
[] Non-interactive text


Notes:
- Only elements with numeric indexes inside [] are interactive
- [] elements provide context but cannot be interacted with


    Here are some useful examples of the task units you can refer to:
    {"relevant_task_units":[]}
    
    IMPORTANT RULES:
    
1. RESPONSE FORMAT: You must ALWAYS respond with **valid JSON** in this exact format:
{
       
        "current_state": {
            "observation": "Observation of the current state",
            "thought": "Thought of the current state"
        },
         
        "action": [
            {
                "one_action_name": {
                // action-specific parameter
                }
            },
            // ... more actions in sequence
        ]
    }
    
2. ACTIONS: You can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed in sequence. But always specify only one action name per item.

   Common action sequences:
   - Form filling: [
       {"input_text": {"index": 1, "text": "username"}},
       {"input_text": {"index": 2, "text": "password"}},
       {"click_element": {"index": 3}}
     ]
   - Navigation and extraction: [
       {"open_tab": {}},
       {"go_to_url": {"url": "https://example.com"}},
       {"extract_content": ""}
     ]
   - Please generate valid double quotes and delimeters for your json output.

3. ELEMENT INTERACTION:
   - Only use indexes that exist in the provided element list
   - Each element has a unique index number (e.g., "[33]<button>")
   - Elements marked with "[]Non-interactive text" are non-interactive (for context only)

4. TASK COMPLETION:
   - Use the "done" action as the last action as soon as the ultimate task is complete.
   - Dont use "done" before you are done with everything the user asked you.
   - If you have to do something repeatedly for example the task says for "each", or "for all", or "x times", count always inside "memory" how many times you have done it and how many remain. Don't stop until you have completed like the task asked you. Only call done after the last step.
   - Don't hallucinate actions.
   - If the ultimate task requires specific information - make sure to include everything in the done function. This is what the user will see. Do not just say you are done, but include the requested information of the task.
   - use maximum 1 actions per sequence

    Functions:
    Complete task with response to user: 
{done: {'text': {'type': 'string'}}}

: Based on the provided text from the Mayo Clinic page on chest pain, here are some possible causes for sharp chest pain accompanied by anxiety:

### 1. **Heart Attack**
   - **Description:** Chest pain that lasts more than 15 minutes, may feel like pressure, tightness, pain, squeezing or aching. Symptoms can spread to the shoulder, arm, back, neck, jaw, teeth, or upper belly.
   - **Associated Symptoms:** Shortness of breath, cold sweats, fatigue, lightheadedness, nausea, heartburn.
   - **Anxiety Connection:** Anxiety can accompany a heart attack due to the severity and fear of the situation. Additionally, anxiety symptoms can mimic some aspects of a heart attack.

### 2. **Angina**
   - **Description:** Chest pain or discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. The pain can be described as squeezing, pressure, or heaviness on the chest.
   - **Associated Symptoms:** Similar to a heart attack but typically lasts less than five minutes and can be relieved with rest or medication.
   - **Anxiety Connection:** Anxiety can exacerbate angina symptoms, leading to increased chest pain. Some individuals with angina may experience heightened anxiety due to fear of a heart attack.

### 3. **Pericarditis**
   - **Description:** Swelling and irritation of the tissue surrounding the heart. Characterized by sharp chest pain that worsens with coughing, lying down, or deep breathing.
   - **Associated Symptoms:** Sharp chest pain that can feel similar to a heart attack but is often made worse by certain movements or positions.
   - **Anxiety Connection:** The sharp nature of the pain and its resemblance to a heart attack can induce significant anxiety.

### 4. **Pneumonia with Pleurisy**
   - **Description:** Infection of the air sacs in the lungs combined with inflammation of the tissue surrounding the lung. Symptoms include chest pain, especially when taking a breath or coughing.
   - **Associated Symptoms:** Chills, fever, cough producing bloody or foul-smelling sputum.
   - **Anxiety Connection:** The pain and other symptoms can cause considerable distress and anxiety, particularly if mistaken for a heart-related issue.

### 5. **Chest Wall Pain (Costochondritis)**
   - **Description:** Muscle pain in the chest wall, often due to bruising from coughing, straining, or minor injuries. Symptoms include pain and tenderness in the area connecting the ribs to the breastbone.
   - **Associated Symptoms:** Tenderness upon touching the affected area.
   - **Anxiety Connection:** While chest wall pain is usually not life-threatening, the sharp nature of the pain can lead to anxiety, especially if the individual fears a more serious condition.

### General Considerations:
- **Anxiety Alone:** Anxiety itself can cause physical symptoms, including sharp chest pain. This phenomenon is known as anxiety-induced chest pain. In such cases, managing the underlying anxiety can alleviate the chest pain.
  
### Conclusion:
Sharp chest pain accompanied by anxiety can stem from various causes, ranging from serious conditions like heart attacks and pericarditis to less severe issues like chest wall pain. It is crucial for anyone experiencing such symptoms to seek immediate medical attention, especially if they suspect a heart attack or another serious condition. Prompt evaluation by a healthcare professional is essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
